## ToggleTransparent
v1.0.0 - by wit117

#### Description
This mod takes keyboard input to toggle DesktopMate's interaction, bypassing all mouse input except cursor tracking.
When interaction is disabled, DesktopMate turns into a 'transparent' mode, redirecting mouse input to window behind.

#### How to use
Default key for toggling the state is ** F8 ** .
Please note that key only works when DesktopMate window is focused, so when enabling the interaction, ** you should focus the window by Alt+Tab ** or other method.

* I tried to resolve this problem, but it kinda feels like a rabbit hole, at least to me :( *
